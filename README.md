# Carts Of Glory Custom Maps
#### *A easy method of swapping and using custom maps in Carts Of Glory*


## Setup

Firstly we need the mod unlocker to allow us to do whats called soft file modding \
Download [Unreal Mod Unlocker](https://illusory.dev/) from here (*we only need the basic one*)

Now open and install that and patch the game (its also recommended to copy your base game folder and have a modded/patched version as we are going to be modifying game files).

if you need help with such there is a tutorial from the person who created the tool [here](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxVNSm7LoOvsfQQ9WrVq44upcBOC5C98qe?si=ZRh0zl8izbs3HFVM)


next we if you are either using any maps made by me or made with [my template](https://github.com/l-S4M-l/Carts-Of-Glory-Custom-Maps/blob/main/Example%20Project.zip) you will need to extract [This](https://github.com/l-S4M-l/Carts-Of-Glory-Custom-Maps/blob/main/Engine.zip) zip file into the root folder of your game directory as seen below.

## Installation
#### Now we have all that setup lets get on with actually getting custom maps in the game.

Firstly go here and select a map you like [MAPS](https://github.com/l-S4M-l/Carts-Of-Glory-Custom-Maps/blob/main/Maps/Map%20List.MD)

Now all you have to do is extract the files into the root game folder as seen below,
