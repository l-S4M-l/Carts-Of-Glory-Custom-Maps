# Carts Of Glory Custom Maps
#### *A easy method of swapping and using custom maps in Carts Of Glory*


## Installation

Firstly we need the mod unlocker to allow us to do whats called soft file modding \
Download [Unreal Mod Unlocker](https://illusory.dev/) from here (*we only need the basic one*)

next we if you are either using any maps made by me or made with [my template](https://github.com/l-S4M-l/Carts-Of-Glory-Custom-Maps/blob/main/Example%20Project.zip) you will need to extract [This](https://github.com/l-S4M-l/Carts-Of-Glory-Custom-Maps/blob/main/Engine.zip) zip file into the root folder of your game directory as seen below,
